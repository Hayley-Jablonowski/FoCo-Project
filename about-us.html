        <h3 class="cardH1">Family Owned</h3>
        <p>Cookie Monster Company was founded in 2001 and is owned by a husband and wife team, Tom and Janet. Their business began with selling homemade macarons out of their home kitchen and eventually grew to become their dream company. The team was able to open their very first storefront in spring of 2006 and in 2008, they released the catering portion of their company. Since then, they've been able to grow their menu to include other types of pasteries, cookies, cakes, coffee's, tea's and more.</p>

        <p> Tom, Janet and all employees at the Cookie Monster Company, strive to provide support and give back to their local community as much as possible. Most recently, they've been helping the local community by feeding those with food insecurity by passing out food boxes to those in need. Additionaly, they've helped their neighbors stay safe amidst the COVID-19 pandemic by passing out PPE and donating equipment to the local hospitals and urgent care clinics.</p>
